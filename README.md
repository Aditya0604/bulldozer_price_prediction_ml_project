# bulldozer_price_prediction_ml_project
my self project to predict bulldozer prices based on previous data 
I was not able to upload train.csv as file size was larger than 25mb and github only allows upto 25mb file. 
so here is the link of the kaggle dataset I used:-https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data
or you can directly use the train.csv file that I have uploaded in my gdrive :-https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k_7v2vM-DlY9LUk-7YgXy81pRIrPEGsW/view?usp=sharing
